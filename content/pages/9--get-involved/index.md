All humans across the globe can rally around the idea of eating more plants and raw foods, and that includes you! There are plenty of ways to become involved in the raw plants movement 

## Raw Plants Foundation Memberships

There are three different types of memberships that represent different ways in which you can participate furthering the missions of The Raw Plants Foundation.

- ## Spirit Member
  Spirit member are those who are with us in spirit. They truly believe in values of The Raw Plants Foundation and try their best to eat a diet based on raw plants. Registering as a spirit member is free. Once you [register as a spirit member](http://www.derp.com), it's simply a mental commitment to believe in and practice the the guidelines of our raw plants mantra.

- ## Active Member

Once you [register as an active member](http://www.derp.com), you can use the calendar browser application to schedule which days and times you would like to volunteer. _Please Note that currently all of our volunteer events are located in New York City. Please [contact us](/contact) if you'd like to organize an event in other location. 

- ## Charitable Member
  Charitable members are those who contribute monetarily to The Raw Plants Foundation. Donations from our charitable members make up the vast majority of our funds. We wanted to make the bar so low that hardly anyone would be burdened financially by the amount required to donate in order to be designated a charitable member. This is why you can donate as little as $2.99 per month for one calendar year to become a charitable member of the Raw Plants Foundation!
 
- ## Distinguished Member
  Those members who are most involved and have achieved all three of the above membership designations will then be considered distinguished members, the most highly respected and regarded for their great contributions of time, energy, and money towards this cause that we value so highly: raw plants.

##### _All current members are listed on the [Who We Are](/who-we-are) page._
