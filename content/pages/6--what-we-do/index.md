title: What We Do
---

Here at The Raw Plants Foundation we have two missions:

- ### To promote an abundance of available, healthy plants for human consumption.
- ### To spread knowledge about the benefits of eating a raw plants-based diet.   
	
Now let’s dive a bit deeper into the work we do to realize these missions.

## "Plants To Enhance" Giveaway & Subsidy Programs

The Raw Plants Foundation is proud to say that we give away tons (literally!) of raw plants every year. Our various programs aim to bring more raw plants to all areas of society from schools to the workplace to the city streets.

### "Raw Plants Workforce" Initiative
We give away raw plants to workplaces around the country to promote a healthy, focused atmosphere for getting stuff done. Please [contact us](/contact) for more information on scheduling an essembly in your office or workplace! 

### “Plants For Peds” (canvassing / giving away raw plants to pedestrians)
We give away raw plants to pedestrians around New York City (and soon other cities too!) so if you see us around don't be afraid to say hi!

## Spreading Knowledge And Raising Awareness
We want people to know the truth and be enlightened. Instead of beleiving blindly from us that raw plants are great for you, we want each person to take the time, to do their own research, to really look at all the data and scientific evidence, and to then come to a conclusion for yourself whether the raw plants lifestyle is for you. 


### “Raw Plants Are Lit” School Assembly Program
School assemblies where we educate students on the importance of eating raw plants and provide free plants for students to consume. Please [contact us](/contact) for more information on scheduling an essembly in your school!

### “Raw Plants Meetup Groups
There are some fantastic groups that already meet regularly who focus on raw foods.

### Blog
The blog is where we are able to write posts and articles that deep dive into one aspect of raw plants, the movement, and the foundation. If you have any questions that may inspire interesting blog posts feel free to reach out and [contact us](/contact).
