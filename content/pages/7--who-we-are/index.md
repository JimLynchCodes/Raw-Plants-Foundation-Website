title: Who We Are
---

We the members of the raw plants foundation, are the enlightened individuals who have realized that a raw-plants-based diet is the optimal human diet in terms of promoting proper organ functionality, mental clarity, muscle tone and strength, disease prevention, and overall health.

## Founder - Jim Lynch

Jim is somewhat of a modern Benjamin Franklin. He is a mathematician, computer programmer, athlete, speaker, and philosopher. While growing up on a conventional diet Jim experienced increasingly worse pains and symptoms in his digestion, mind, skin, mood, and joints. It was only after moving to a plant-based diet focused on raw plants (and for him, specific raw plants) that he was able to consume energy from the earth and thrive every day. Today, he helps others to reach their full potential with raw plants.
