He is a mathematician, computer programmer, athlete, speaker, and philosopher. While growing up on a conventional diet Jim experienced increasingly worse pains and symptoms in his digestion, mind, skin, mood, and joints. It was only after moving to a plant-based diet focused on raw plants (and for him, specific raw plants) that he was able to consume energy from the earth and thrive every day. Today, he helps others to reach their full potential with raw plants.</p>\n<h2>Elected Officers -</h2>\n<h4>Chairman - Jim Lynch</h4>\n<h2>Community Members -</h2>\n<h3>Spirit Members</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Bob Jones</li>\n<li>Dominic Swithlesticks</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>active member - (20+ hours of service per year)</h3>\n<p>charitable member ($10+ donation per year)</p>\n<p>distinguished members\n(stiff the conditions for 1. spirit member, 2. active member, and 3. charitable member</p>\n<p>Current  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>stock images of raw plants</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Delete extra pages in footer</p>\n<p>â€”</p>\n<p>Terms and Privacy to Footer</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Who We Are"}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"facebook":{"appId":""}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/who-we-are/","source":"pages"}}
