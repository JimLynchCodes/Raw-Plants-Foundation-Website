Our Motto Is, “Eat Raw More Plants”, And Not, “Eat Only Raw Plants”

—-

(What We Do)

We have two missions:
	- To promote an abundance of available, healthy plants for human consumption.
	- To spread knowledge about the benefits of eating a raw plants-based diet.   Now let’s dive a bit deeper into what work we do to realize these missions.

    - Raw Plants Giveaway & Raw Plants Subsidy Programs
	- “Raw Plants Are Lit” program (for children / schools)
	- Raw Plants Workforce Initiative
	- “Plants For Peds” (canvassing / giving away raw plants to pedestrians)

Spreading Knowledge About Raw Plants And Humans

	- Meetup groups / larger events
	- Speaking engagements
	- Blog
		-  enzymes in plants and what happens when you overheat them.

Who We Are

We the members of the raw plants foundation, are the enlightened individuals who have realized that a raw-plants-based diet is the optimal human diet in terms of promoting proper organ functionality, mental clarity, muscle tone and strength, disease prevention, and overall health.

Founder - Jim Lynch

Jim is somewhat of a modern Benjamin Franklin. He is a mathematician, computer programmer, athlete, speaker, and philosopher. While growing up on a conventional diet Jim experienced increasingly worse pains and symptoms in his digestion, mind, skin, mood, and joints. It was only after moving to a plant-based diet focused on raw plants (and for him, specific raw plants) that he was able to consume energy from the earth and thrive every day. Today, he helps others to reach their full potential with raw plants.
